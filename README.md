# DreamHost Dynamic DNS Record Update

`dhdynupdate` is a Python 3 utility for Linux. Other operating systems may
work, but have not been tested.

The purpose of `dhdynupdate` is similar to a number of dynamic DNS updaters on
the internet: to update DNS records with IP addresses for your local machine
for a domain hosted by [DreamHost](https://www.dreamhost.com), using the
[DreamHost API](http://wiki.dreamhost.com/Application_programming_interface).

When started using the systemd service file, `dhdynupdate` as an unprivileged
process. `dhdynudpate` can also execute as your user process.

## Features ##

* `dhdynupdate` supports updating both A and AAAA (IPv4 and IPv6) addresses.
* DNS records are updated on an as-needed basis to avoid sending unnecessary
DreamHost API calls
* `dhdynupdate` verifies & updates the DNS records for the configured
hostname upon dæmon instantiation
    * From there, `dhdynupdate` check your local IPv4 and/or IPv6 addresses.
    * If a IPv4/IPv6 address changes, `dhdynupdate` will update the
      corresponding entry in your DreamHost DNS Zone.

## Dependencies
`dhdynupdate` uses the following external modules:

* [`daemon`](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-daemon/)
    * Available in Debian/Ubuntu as `python3-daemon`
* [`netifaces`](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/netifaces)
    * Available in Debian/Ubuntu as `python3-netifaces`
* [`requests`](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/)
    * Available in Debian/Ubuntu as `python3-requests`

# Installation
No binary packages exist yet, but, I've tested the following configuration on a
Debian Unstable/Sid system.

There is not an "easy" installation at this time; you will be required to copy
files into their proper destinations, and create a user for the dæmon to
execute as.

* Install dependencies:  
    * On Debian or Ubuntu, you should be able to:  `apt-get install python3-daemon python3-netifaces python3-requests`
* Create a `dhdynupdate` user/group for the dhdynupdate dæmon to execute as
* Copy (or clone) the git repository to `/usr/local/dhdyupdate`
* Copy `dhdynupdate.conf` to `/etc/`
* Create a directory for the logfile:
    `mkdir -p /var/log/dhdynupdate`
    `chown dhdynupdate:dhdynupdate /var/log/dhdynupdate`
* Install/activate the systemd service file:
    * Copy `dhdynupdate.service` to `/lib/systemd/system/`
    * `systemctl daemon-reload`
    * `systemctl enable dhdynupdate.service`

# Configuration
Configuration goes in `dhdynupdate.conf`, and is in the [Python 'config' file format.](https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html#supported-ini-file-structure)

## TL;DR config:
* Modify the following entires in `/etc/dhdynudpate.conf`:

	`AF_INET =  <interface with the IPv4 address you want to add to DreamHost DNS>`  
	`AF_INET6 = <interface with the IPv6 address you want to add to DreamHost DNS>`  

* Under `[your.domain.com]`, modify:

	`api_key = <your DreamHost API key>`
	`local_hostname = <the hostname you wish to add to DreamHost DNS>`


## Config File Sections
###`Global`
This section has global configuration options:

* Network interfaces to update the DNS records for. Empty string interfaces are ignored. The special interface "-ipify.org" performs an external lookup.
* [The DreamHost Web API URL](http://wiki.dreamhost.com/Application_programming_interface), and the logfile location.

###`DreamHost API Test Account`

* Uses The DreamHost test API key
* Only allows read-only operations
* It's a useful example to show the file format as well as a harmless test

###`your.domain.name`

* Insert `your.domain.name` for the name of your domain name.
* Also put in your DreamHost API key.

        [Global]
        # The DreamHost API URL; doubtful it'll change
        api_url = https://api.dreamhost.com/
        # External IPv4 and IPv6 interface to use
        # Separated as the subnet provided by my ISP is on a different interface
        # than the routing IP on my external interface.
        # IPv4 is the AF_INET address family
        AF_INET = eth1
        # IPv6 is the AF_INET6 family
        AF_INET6 = eth0
        # Log file
        log_file = /var/log/dhdynupdate.log
        # The update interval (in seconds)
        # for reference, 1h = 3600 s
        update_interval = 3600
        # PID file location
        pidfile = /run/dhdynupdate/dhdynupdate.pid
        
        [DreamHost API Test Account]
        api_key = 6SHU5P2HLDAYECUM
        local_hostname = ssh.thebesthostever.com
        
        [your.domain.name]
        api_key=6SHU5P2HLDAYECUM
        local_hostname = a6.groo.com

# Generating a DreamHost API Key

If you don't already have an appropriate API key:

* [Generate a new API key:](https://panel.dreamhost.com/?tree=home.api)
    * Make sure that `dns-*` is checked
    * Make sure *everything else* is unchecked

# Command-line usage

	usage: dhdynupdate.py [-h] [-d] [--debug lvl] [-c config]
	
	optional arguments:
	  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
	  -d, --daemon          Execute dhdynupdate.py as a dæmon
	  --debug lvl           Log Level, one of CRITICAL, ERROR, WARNING, INFO,
	                        DEBUG
	  -c config, --config config
	                        Configuration name

If executed in daemon mode, `dhdynupdate` will dæmonize into a background
process, suitable for management using an init script or via systemd.

A config name is the name of the `dhdynupdate.conf` section you wish to use.
Multiple hostnames and API keys can be configured, enabling you to configure
multiple DNS domains or hostnames, and select which one to update at runtime.
 
For example, `./dhdynupdate.py -c your.domain.com` will load the
`[your.domain.name]` section in the `dhdynupdate.conf`.

# TODO:

* Proper [Python packaging](https://python-packaging.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)
* Maybe an RPM or Debian package
* OS X support
