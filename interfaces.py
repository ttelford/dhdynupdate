"""
This module gets the current IPv4 and/or IPv6 addresses of the network
interfaces provided.

While we could get the full set of interface information using
netifaces, for this module, we are only interested in one IPv4 and one
IPv6 address, each having been provided by the configuration

See [netifaces documentation](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/netifaces)

netifaces provides a somewhat standardized method of getting interface
information, such as IP addresses.

Technically, interfaces can have multiple IP addresses, but multiple
addresses is not often the case with home users.
* This chooses the first address for the interface, which covers the use
  case of many users who only use one ip address per interface.

Also handles the case where an address family isn't used:
* Not everybody has IPv6.
* Maybe a user is behind a NAT on IPv4, and is only updating their IPv6
  address in DNS.
